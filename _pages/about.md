Hey there, thank you visiting my website!



I am a very curious scientist who took some time from business to learn more about exciting topics. 

I worked as a data scientist and bioinformatics researcher. 

My interests span generally in the entire machine learning lifecycle with a particular focus on scalable infrastructures, deep learning, and applications in biotechnology. I am also enthusiastic about bioinformatics and data visualization.

This place serves as my personal portfolio for projects and readings so feel free to comment or contact me directly via mail, every feedback is welcome and encouraged.
